```{r}
##1) Save the data to a CSV file. 


## This is heart data from kaggle for sample of people with heart disease include some medical informations from Clevland Research Center database, can be found on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci/version/1



heart <- data.frame(read.csv(file = 'C:/Users/Talal/Documents/GitHub/Data_Visualization/heart.csv'))


heart


```

```{r}
##2) Create two vectors from two columns from the Dataframe. Be sure to name these appropriately. 
#Age Column1
print ("AGE")
age <- heart[,1]
age


#sex Column ,  1 for male ,0 for female ,
print ("SEX")
sex <- heart[,2]
sex

#cheast pain from 0 to 3 
print ("CheastPain")
CheastPain <- heart[,3]
CheastPain

#restbps resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
print ("restbps")
restbps <- heart[,4]
restbps

#cholestrole serum cholestoral in mg/dl
print ("Cholestrole")
Cholestrole <- heart[,5]
Cholestrole


#Target 0 or 1 
print ("Target")
Target <- heart[,14]
Target


```



```{r}
##3) Using a for loop and seq_along, find the mean of the first vector. Store the mean in an appropriate variable.

getMean <- function(x){

  for (i in seq_along(x)){
    
    mean <- mean(x)
    
  }
  mean
}


AgeMean <- getMean(age)
print("AgeMean")
AgeMean 

CholestroleMean <- getMean(Cholestrole)
print("CholestroleMean")
CholestroleMean 


CheastPainMean <- getMean(CheastPain)
print("CheastPainMean")
CheastPainMean 

restbpsMean <- getMean(restbps)
print("restbpsMean")
restbpsMean

```


```{r}
##4) Create a function that when called on each of the elements in your vector, finds the mean. Hint, you will use scoping rules to accumulate two global environment variables.

getMean2 <- function(x){
  nr = NROW(x)
  
  sum = 0
  for (i in seq_along(x)){
    
    sum = sum+ sum(x[i])
  }
  mean2 = sum/nr
  
}


AgeMean2 <- getMean2(age)
print("AgeMean2")
AgeMean2 

CholestroleMean2 <- getMean2(Cholestrole)
print("CholestroleMean2")
CholestroleMean2 


CheastPainMean2 <- getMean2(CheastPain)
print("CheastPainMean2")
CheastPainMean2 

restbpsMean2 <- getMean2(restbps)
print("restbpsMean2")
restbpsMean2 
```




```{r}
##5) Using lapply and your own you created in the previous step to find the sum and number of elements of the second vector. 
# the sex table will just have values 0 , 1s I created a list of columns with age, Cholestrole, CheastPain vectors


print ("get the mean by the first method")
mytable <- list( age,Cholestrole, CheastPain , restbps)
getMeans <- lapply(mytable,getMean)
getMeans

print("get the mean by the second method:")
mytable <- list( age,Cholestrole, CheastPain , restbps)
getMeansLapply <- lapply(mytable,getMean2)
getMeansLapply


```
